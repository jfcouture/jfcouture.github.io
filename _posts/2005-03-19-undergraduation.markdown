[Undergraduation](http://paulgraham.com/college.html)


<blockquote>
The social sciences are also fairly bogus, because they're so much influenced by intellectual fashions. If a physicist met a colleague from 100 years ago, he could teach him some new things; if a psychologist met a colleague from 100 years ago, they'd just get into an ideological argument.</blockquote>



That was too funny to pass on. I normally don't really like what Paul Graham has to say, but this time he nailed something that I never could quite articulate by myself about social science.
