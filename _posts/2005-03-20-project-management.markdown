[Managing Product Development](http://www.jrothman.com/weblog/archive/2005_03_01_mpdarchive.html#110978825704411482)


<blockquote>Not everyone will enjoy the opportunity to learn something new. Some people will reject all of your attempts to have them try something new. Then it's time to ask yourself if these people are truly contributing what you need contributed to the organization. </blockquote>



Another quote from [Johana Rothman](http://www.jrothman.com/weblog/blogger.html). If you are interested in management, I strongly suggest adding her blog to your news feeder.

This quote is a followup to my previous post. It's something I have a bit of a problem with. I personaly like to always work on new stuff, to improve myself. I have trouble understanding people who don't enjoy that also. It leads to situation where I think I'm proposing something interesting to someone and I end up a bit angry when I don't get the expected answer.
