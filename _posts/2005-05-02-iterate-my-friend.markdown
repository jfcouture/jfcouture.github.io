[Managing Product Development](http://www.jrothman.com/weblog/archive/2005_05_01_mpdarchive.html#111505743843757607)


<blockquote>But the best technique I know is to use iterations (2-4 week long iterations). That way, you can release virtually at any time. You know that the contents of each iteration works. You know you've implemented the most important requirements first. And it's ok if management wants to release -- because the product is ready.</blockquote>
