I just bought an iMac. Seriously. About one hour ago. I think I was possessed by some kind of demon at the time. I mean, there is no way I can rationally justify this purchase. So I bought an iPod to go with it. There is a deal this summer for student (free ipod mini or 225$ off). Don't tell anybody.
