[sirenian: BDD: The campaign against testing](http://www.livejournal.com/users/sirenian/26805.html)


<blockquote>"Test", in Test Driven Development, encapsulates the idea of specification, design, verification of implementation and the ability to confidently refactor. Regression testing itself is almost a by-product of these uses of the word "test".(...)Don't test; think "What should this class do? What are its roles and responsibilities? What does it do to the things I'm going to give to it?" Then write a method which will describe the class's behaviour.</blockquote>



Words shape the way we think. I just found about behavior driven development (BDD). It's a subtle change in terminology but it focuses more on what the tests really are trying to accomplish. I kinda like it.

BTW, read the article to find out what is a ScalpelSheepVisitor.
