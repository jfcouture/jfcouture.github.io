In the last few months, I have accumulated quite a lot of blogging material. I will get on a weekly posting schedule.

My first post next week will be a retrospective of [CUSEC 2006](http://cusec2006.soen.info/), a conference on software engineering here in Montreal. We have mr. Rails himself, David Heinemeier Hansson, talking and also my favorite blogger, Kathy Sierra, of [Creating Passionate Users](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/)  fame. I can't wait!
