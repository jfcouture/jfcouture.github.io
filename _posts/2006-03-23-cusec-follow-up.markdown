For those of you who missed CUSEC, another keynote is now available at
[SOENlive](http://www.soenlive.com/2006/03/22/kathy-people-are-still-talking-about-you/), this time the great keynote from [Kathy Sierra](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/). The first keynote [“Rails is Boring and Ruby Is A Toy”](http://www.soenlive.com/2006/02/26/episode-001-chad-fowler-presents-rails-is-boring/) from [Chad Fowler](http://www.chadfowler.com/) is also available.

I have not posted much in the last few weeks. I've been busy learning [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/). I have convinced my company that it is the right choice for us.  Six weeks later, everything is going smoothly. My nightmares about trying to add new features in ASP.Net have stopped. I'm having fun again developing software. I strongly suggest you try Rails if you're having the blues at your job. It's a great cure.

And now, the quote of the day:


<blockquote>A memorable quote from Kent was "Agile development does not mean never having to say you're sorry". </blockquote>
