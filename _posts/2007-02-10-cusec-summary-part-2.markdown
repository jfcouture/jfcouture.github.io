I wanted to write a more detailed post about CUSEC, like I did last year. I tried a couple of times but I couldn't find a really good way of putting it all together. I always wanted my blog to help me get better at writing. Maybe I put too much pressure on myself to write a long article.


However, there certainly were a couple of interesting ideas I heard at the conference that I want to share, or at least that I want to catalog in my blog. So here they are, at random (well not totally, in the order I heard them):




### Day 1




Pete McBreen





    
  * The "It works as designed" mindset. (There was a very funny example about a motorcycle, anyone remembers what it was?)

    
  * We should sign our work, take responsibility for the systems we create.

    
  * Learn from experience with project retrospectives.

    
  * We need to promote fun process because excitement is a good predictor of quality.




Austin Hill





    
  * Startups can stay small today.

    
  * VCs expect market traction for a software company, so it's important to get it out soon.

    
  * Find mentors and coaches.

    
  * Technical risks are low today. You take creative risk.

    
  * Forget plans. Have fun. Choose what not to do.




Greg Brill





    
  * Aptitude. Attitude. Experience. Favor the first two.

    
  * Elevator pitch can be summed to "What do you want?".

    
  * Trust your instincts.

    
  * Attitude is king. Avoid the bitch cluster.




Other presentations of the day:





    
  * Jim Cordy about what is a professionnal software engineer.

    
  * Someone from SAP talks about Web 2.0




### Day 2




Dave Thomas





    
  * Dave starts his presentation by taking off his shoes.

    
  * Use of fear to manipulate. FUD is used to sell.

    
  * Risk management is important

    
  * You can't live without taking risks.

    
  * Do not be afraid to make mistakes.

    
  * Opposite of risk is stagnation.




Ralph Johnson





    
  * The word maintenance has a bad stigma.

    
  * Maintenance is increasing.

    
  * Programming is program transformation.




Other presentations of the day:





    
  * Dr Lee McIntyre about the User Experience team at Business Objects.

    
  * A presentation of Mylar, an interesting plugin for Eclipse.

    
  * Panel discussion wasn't very good, lacking direction and a central theme.




### Day 3




Venkat Subramaniam





    
  * The key to beginning agility: attitude.

    
  * Fixing problems is a top priority, not blames.

    
  * A mistake is an oppportunity to learn.

    
  * Keep up with change, but keep your balance.

    
  * Take control.Â  Find a rhythm for everything. Tackle tasks regularly. Set small goals.

    
  * Don't listen, educate customer.

    
  * Decide what you shouldn't decide.

    
  * Timeboxing.




Other presentations of the day:





    
  * Geoff Guenther, about high performance databases at Direct Energy.

    
  * Timothy Lethbridge, about the resistance to HCI.

    
  * Kokoromi







Well that's it for CUSEC for 2007. Going through my notes, there clearly was an idea that come up a lot: Make mistakes and learn from them.
