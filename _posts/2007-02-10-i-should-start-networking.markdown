My last post got a trackback, which is really cool, especially considering my posting frequency ;). It also happens to be an awesome post jam-packed with juicy stuff, titled [Canada's Mojo Rising](http://www.billionswithzeroknowledge.com/2007/02/09/canadas-mojo-rising-it-takes-a-canadian-to-build-a-community/). It's from Austin Hill, which I talked a bit about in my last post, and it's about the emerging tech entrepreneurship in Montreal. Reading his post made me realize that I really need to start networking and it also provides a great list of starting points with upcoming events. I'm a bit ashamed that I didn't attend the DemoCamp at CUSEC. Fortunately, it's not too late to start!
