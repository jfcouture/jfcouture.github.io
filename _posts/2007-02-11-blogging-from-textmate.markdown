I was reading a sample chapter of [TextMate Power Editing for the Mac](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/textmate/index.html) about all the bundles in TextMate. Of course, the one for html is really nice and solves almost everything that I hate about writing a blog post. Looking through the rest of the bundles, what do I see? One for blogging. I'm pretty you know by now what happened next.
