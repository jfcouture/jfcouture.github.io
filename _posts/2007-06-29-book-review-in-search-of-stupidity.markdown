[In Search Of Stupidity: Over 20 Years Of High-Tech Marketing Disasters, by Merrill R. Chapman, 2nd edition](http://www.amazon.ca/Search-Stupidity-High-Tech-Marketing-Disasters/dp/1590597214/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/702-6130951-1732023?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1182023139&sr=8-1)

ISOS looks at the last 25 years of computing and provides an interesting look at what went wrong for some companies: how [Wordstar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordStar) lost the word processor market, the failure of the [IBM PC Junior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_Junior), what happened at Ashton-Tate with [dBase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBASE), etc.

**Positives:** The writing is really engaging. Once you start the book, you will not put it down. All the stories are very interesting and well written.

**Negatives:** There isn't a lot of analysis of what went wrong. It's mostly the facts, plus a "they made a positioning mistake" sentence and that's it. I do not understand how the in fighting between two groups of developers at a company can be considered a marketing mistake. Sometimes the author likes to be clever and his humor might annoy some people.

**Conclusion:** Well worth your time if you like reading about the history of the computer industry and if you would like to avoid some of these mistakes yourself.
