Yesterday morning, I attended my first MTEBM at Bistro etc. I've always been a bit shy, but it was surprisingly easy (even for me) to start talking. I met some very nice people and the energy level was high.

Mark Schanzleh and his partner Amélie Racine talked about [staynomad](http://staynomad.com/), their travel startup. Mark is very passionate and he probably could have talked about his project all morning long. I had a very interesting (and mostly technical) talk with [Marc-André Cournoyer](http://macournoyer.wordpress.com/) and [Pierre Phaneuf](http://pphaneuf.livejournal.com/). On my way back, I had the chance to discuss with [Mathieu Balez](http://web1979.wordpress.com/). He's a smart guy and I can't wait to see what new project he is working on. He is also starting a [Montreal on Rails](http://www.montrealonrails.com/) community, with the first meeting around August 7.

You can read [Marc-André's](http://macournoyer.wordpress.com/2007/07/11/high-times) and [Heri's](http://montrealtechwatch.com/2007/07/10/6th-montreal-tech-entrepreneur-breakfast/) report with some photos.
