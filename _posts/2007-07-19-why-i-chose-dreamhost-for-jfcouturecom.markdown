I was quiet last week as I was investigating moving my [blog](http://djief.textdriven.com) to a different hosting company. I have been with [Textdrive](http://textdrive.com) for the last 2 years. They're not bad, but they sure don't provide an exceptional value. For 15$/month, you get anemic space and bandwith, a very slow, ugly and almost useless web panel. Since last year, you also get three other services from [Joyent](http://www.joyent.com/), such as [Strongspace](http://joyent.com/connector/Secure-Backups), but they're not something I need.

With [DreamHost](http://dreamhost.com), I get a boatload of storage and bandwith for 10$/month. Better, google for dreamhost coupon, and you get 90$ off. My first year is gonna cost me 30$. Their web panel is nice and simple and even includes a one-click installer for [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org). There's also a 97 money back guarantee so I have time to investigate if my rails apps are gonna work. I hear support isn't great, but they have a lot customers so you can google your problem and easily find a solution most of time.
