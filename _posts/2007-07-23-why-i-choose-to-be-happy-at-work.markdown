Just some clarification on my previous [post.](http://jfcouture.com/2007/07/21/the-happy-at-work-manifesto/) I took the first step towards happiness when I quit my job about two months ago. I won't get into the details of why I left. But suffice to say it has made huge impact on my mood. And that's the part of the [manifesto](http://positivesharing.com/2007/07/the-happy-at-work-manifesto/) I like the most:


<blockquote>7: I know that my happiness at work affects my happiness outside of work.</blockquote>


Waking up in the morning and knowing of all the opportunities open to me is a very different feel than the dread related to going to a job I didn't like anymore. Are you happy at work?
