Last monday was the second edition of the book club. Once again there were a lot of great discussions on a wide range of subjects. I had the chance to catch up with an ex colleague, Mathieu Jacques, developper extraordinaire at [Dakis Decision Systems](http://www.dakis.com). [Heri](http://montrealtechwatch.com/) and [Patrick Tanguay](http://i.never.nu/) completed the foursome.

Heri wrote a very comprehensive [report](http://montrealtechwatch.com/2007/08/01/web-development-book-club-july-30th/) if you want more details on the books discussed. The next edition will be on 27th of August, 7pm, at Laika. If you enjoy discussing around a beer, please come!
