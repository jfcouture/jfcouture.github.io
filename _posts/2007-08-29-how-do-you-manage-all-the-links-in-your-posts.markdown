Every time I write a post, it seems I spend a large amount of time putting the links in. My last post contained seven links and it feels like it took an eternity to put them in. I have to open another browser window, google the page, copy the link and then paste it in my post. For some reason, it feels like a very tedious process. I'm wondering if anybody has any tricks they use to make it faster? How do you manage all the links in your posts?
