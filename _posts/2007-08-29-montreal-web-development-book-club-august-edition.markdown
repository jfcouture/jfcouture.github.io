Last monday was the third edition of the book club. We grew to a party of five this time. [Heri](http://montrealtechwatch.com/) talked about Building Scalable Websites, a book by Cal Henderson, lead developer of [flickr](http://flickr.com). Even though Heri recommends the book, he didn't seem very passionate talking about it. He says it covers a lot ground, but there is only one chapter that talks specifically about flickr. It led to a discussion about denormalization. People thought that few knew about it, or that they weren't pragmatic enough about it.

[Chris Lamothe](http://furtivecode.com/) then presented [Textmate: Power Editing for the Mac](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/textmate/). He liked it a lot as it allowed him to really understand the power of [Textmate](http://macromates.com/). I'm halfway through the book and like it, but I'm surprised that about two thirds of the book are consecrated to building your own automations. I was expecting more on the editing side.

Next book was [Scrum and Xp From the Trenches](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches), which is available as a free pdf. [Fred Brunel](http://www.fredbrunel.com/journal/) and I had a very lengthy discussion about process in general. It's been a while since I talked about process, which used to be one of my favorite subject. I feel I've read enough about Agile in general (I think I'm [post-agile](http://www.kohl.ca/blog/archives/000184.html) now), but the book seems short and contains actual experiences instead of just principles and practices, so I might take a look at it.
