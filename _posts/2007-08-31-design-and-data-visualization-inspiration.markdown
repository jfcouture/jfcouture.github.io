I'm always interested and impressed by good examples of design and exciting ways to display information. Here are two links you need to check out and keep around when you need inspiration:



	
  * [45 Excellent Blog Designs](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/08/28/45-excellent-blog-designs/): The title says it all. There is good mix of simple and clean design along with more elaborate designs.

	
  * [Data Visualization: Modern Approaches](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/08/02/data-visualization-modern-approaches/): There are few here that are obtuse in my opinion, but I would kill to get a graph of how my music tastes evolved and varied over the last 10 years such as [this](http://megamu.com/lastfm/).
