[Dan Webb](http://www.danwebb.net) has very very interesting presentation called [Metaprogramming Javascript](http://www.danwebb.net/2007/11/22/media-ajax). I think it's the most simple and understandable explanation of how the diffferent javascript frameworks extend javascript. It takes five minutes to go through and you gain a better appreciation of javascript's simplicity and power.





Here is another [presentation](http://www.adamlogic.com/2007/03/20/3_metaprogramming-javascript-presentation) to put your new knowledge to test that builds a small DSL for working with forms that allows for something like this: show("province-field").when("country").is("Canada").
