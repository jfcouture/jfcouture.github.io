Last night I presented [git](http://git.or.cz/) at [Montreal On Rails](http://www.montrealonrails.com/2008/01/15/followup-on-tonights-event/) and I think it went pretty well. I might have forgotten a few things I wanted to say, but I got quite enough question about other aspects of git to fill an hour, aspects that I didn't expect to be able to squeeze in. Although git is a very different beast than subversion, I feel like most people understood what it is all about. We have some very smart people here in Montreal, and it sure does not look like a ghetto. ;)





Now let me remind you of your homework for the week (it leads toward the path to git enlightenment):







  * Listen to Linus Torvalds [git talk at google](http://youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8). It really helps understanding the design of git.


  * [Install git.](http://jfcouture.com/2007/12/16/installing-git-on-mac-os-x/)


  * If you are currently using svn, see [my guide](http://jfcouture.com/2007/12/12/the-guerilla-guide-to-git-how-to-start-using-git-even-if-your-team-is-on-svn/) on how to start using git while keeping a central svn repository.


  * Explore [parallel universes with branches](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000968.html). Develop a new feature in a branch. Try out a plugin in a branch. Have a branch with rails edge. Do some crazy experimental refactoring in a branch, including renaming files (yes! git will correctly merge).


  * Play with git. Set up local "remote" repository to experience what distributed version control is all about. Try out strange branching scenario just to see how git will handle it.


  * Read the [documentation](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/). See if you can find how to: commit only part of file, send your last 3 commit to another branch, change your last commit (there are 2 ways actually).





I got carried away there. Git rocks.
