I'm beginning to wonder if I wasn't a bit pessimistic when I said [80% of rails developper to switch to git before christmas '08](http://jfcouture.com/2007/12/09/80-of-rails-developers-to-switch-to-git-before-christmas-08-how-to-get-ahead-and-start-now/).  My own unscientific measurement for January show more than 50% of new projects are using git. If you still haven't installed git and are looking for a reason, here's one: [Dr Nic](http://drnicwilliams.com/) is the new maintainer of the [Rails Textmate Bundle](http://drnicwilliams.com/2008/01/31/get-ready-for-the-textmate-trundle-to-rails-20-bundle/) and you'll need git to get it. It includes new helpers specific to Rails 2.0. Speaking of Textmate, it looks like someone picked up the development of [the git bundle](http://gitorious.org/projects/git-tmbundle/repos/mainline/browse). January also saw the release of [thin](http://macournoyer.wordpress.com/category/thin/) and the next version of [merb](http://github.com/wycats/merb-core/tree/master) is now also on git. Seriously, I don't think I need to keep pushing people to git anymore. The momentum is too strong and you will have to use git in the very near future. If you still need more convincing, here are a couple of very interesting links:






  
  * James Golick explains [why distributed version control matters to you](http://jamesgolick.com/2008/1/21/why-distributed-version-control-matters-to-you-today). James writes very well and it should make you understand why you should release your next rails plugin with git.

  
  * This guy is [confused about why distributed version](http://www.danielfischer.com/2008/02/01/all-that-git-talk-in-the-rails-world-what-gives/) rocks so much. He first needs to read James' article. Then you guys with the same feelings toward git need to read the comments.

  
  * Dr Nic [tries to explain git](http://drnicwilliams.com/2008/02/03/using-git-within-a-team/), if you want to understand how to contibute to an open source project.





Hopefully all the links provided should help you understand git from different perspectives. One last goodie for the week: Carl Mercier released a [small script to help work with remote branches](http://blog.carlmercier.com/2008/01/25/no-nonsense-git-part-1-git-remote-branch/). If you want to script common git tasks in ruby, take a look at [Ruby/Git](http://www.jointheconversation.org/rubygit/).
