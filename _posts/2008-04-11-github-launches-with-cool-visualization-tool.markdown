I didn't think I would blog about the launch of [github](http://github.com/), because I thought it was pretty meh. Sure it's nice to put your projects on it and be able to fork other projects, but it was still pretty useless as there was no way of visualizing all the branches ([git is all about the commit graph](http://jfcouture.com/2008/04/02/rails-moving-to-git-how-to-really-understand-and-master-git/)).





Well they just launched the [Network Graph Visualizer](http://github.com/blog/39-say-hello-to-the-network-graph-visualizer) and it rocks! Now you can quickly see the branches/forks and know if they are active or not. Also they added [commit comments](http://github.com/blog/42-commit-comments).





So they fixed their most important flaw and they add features that should make collaboration easier. This makes me really hopeful for github's future. Github is the place to be for open source projects!
