What do you call someone who works at Code Genome?

![Garden Gnomes](http://jfcouture.com/images/garden_gnome.jpg)

It is with great pleasure that I announce that a new gnome has joined the team: [Pierre Olivier Martel](http://www.modelix.net/). PO is our first rails garden gnome guru-to-be. Welcome aboard PO!
