Quick update on where I'm at:

- I started my own software company in april 2010 called [Porkepic Solutions](http://porkepic.com) (the name is a play on the french word for porcupine). We make software for contractors in the construction industry. ([twitter](http://twitter.com/porkepic)) ([blog](http://blog.porkepic.com))
